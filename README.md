# Lab 6 — Participation Exercise

This README contains a detailed task list and verification steps for the Lab 6 Participation Exercise.

Goal
------
Implement and test three methods in `CityList` and add Javadocs to the main source files (`CityList.java` and `City.java`). Finally, generate the Javadocs into `/app/javadocs`.

Quick checklist (high level)
- [ ] Implement `hasCity(City city)` in `CityList`
- [ ] Implement `delete(City city)` in `CityList`
- [ ] Implement `countCities()` in `CityList`
- [ ] Add Javadoc comments to `City.java` and `CityList.java` (all public methods and class-level docs)
- [ ] Add/update unit tests (in `test/java/.../CityListTest.java`) for the above methods
- [ ] Run unit tests: `./gradlew test` and ensure green
- [ ] Generate Javadocs to `/app/javadocs` and verify output
